City Pitch
==========

The Concept:

Are you a long time resident, did you recently move, or looking to move?
Want to know how your city stacks up against the country?  Should you stay or should you go?

Are you an economist, a mayor, a finance minister, a prime minister?
How is your city being beat by the competition?  What can you do about it?

IntuiCity is a powerful tool which converts data into intuitive information about your city.

In data, knowing which questions to ask is difficult.  IntuiCity asks 3 simple questions and unlocks the power of Canadian Open Data.

The workflow:

It's an app that will work on everything from a phone, to a tablet to a PC.

1) The user is asked to pick their city (from a list - no typing) - perhaps we might autofill the field based on IP address (user can then select another)

2) The user is asked what top 3 Lifestyle Values are most important to them (from a list - no typing).  The categories we have so far (these are the categories of the open data):

- health
- employment
- retirement
- education
- security (crime)
- environment/sustainability

3) We will do stats for all the Lifestyle Values, but we weight the top 3 that the user entered the heaviest.

4) For each Lifestyle Value we calculate the average for each city, and do many simple percentages: target city score / (every other city).  We calculate the average score.  We also pick the top three cities.

5) We then display how your city did, and for each Lifestyle Value, which top 3 cities beat it and tell you why (this shows how your city can improve)

6) Based on the weighting of the 3 Lifestyle Values, we compute a general percentage saying how fit your city is.

7) If we have time, using predictive techniques, say what the top 3 most promising future potentials of your city are.
